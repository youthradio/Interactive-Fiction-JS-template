# Interactive Fiction JS template

## Starting

1. Print the JS and HTML code.
1. Indentify and highlight on the paper the following pieces:

    * __Variables__
    * __Functions__
    * __If Else Statements__
    * __HTML Elements using Functions__
    * __HTML Elements IDs__

1. Try to respond the questions:
   1. How the __variables__ are connected to __HTML elements__?
   1. What's the `hidden` attribute in some `<div>` elements? Can you guess what it does?

1. Play the game a few times, then try to go back and read the code.
   1. Can you describe the logic behind it?
   1. Can you indentify parts of the logic on the code? 
   
   
1. Try to extend the game
   1. On the HTML add an Option 2 passage, use an unique new ID
   1. On the JS Can you indentify parts of the logic on the code? 
   
## Basic JS Syntax


* Comments
```js
//Single Line comment

/*
Block Comment
Multiple
Lines
*/
```

* Variable
```js
  var myVariable; //declare undefined
  var myVariable2 = 0; //declare variable and assign  0 Number to it
  var myVariable3 = 'some string text'; //declare variable and assign string text to it
```

* Function
```js
function myFunction(){
  //myFunction is the name of my function definition
  //code block inside brackets {}
}
```

* If Else statements
```js
// For logical operations follow the operators
// === is equal
// !== is different
// < is smaller
// > is bigger
// <= is smaller or equal
// >= is bigger or equal

if(variableA === variableB){
  //if two variable are equal, true
  //do something
} else {
  //if they're not equal, false
  //do something else
}

//multiples tests
if(variableA === somethingA){
  //if two variable are equal, true
  //do something
} else if(variableA === somethingB){
  //if they're not equal, false
  //do something else
} else if(variableA === somethingC){
  //if they're not equal, false
  //do something else
}

```
